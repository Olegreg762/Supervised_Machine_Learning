# **Credit Risk Classification**

In this repo I take financial data and analyze it for loan risk using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms. This is done in the [`Credit Risk Notebook`](credit_risk_resampling.ipynb).<br> 
There is also a [`Credit Risk Report`](credit_risk_report.md) that I put together summarizing the analysis. 

## These are the Decision Trees used by the algorithms.
